              <p className="mt-4">
                FirstWork's proprietary digital reinforcement learning technology harnesses the power of smart devices to address learning deficiencies and excessive technological consumption of entertainment applications. The FirstWork Platform makes learning on smart devices motivating and adaptive by restricting access to entertainment applications until users complete assigned interactive learning activities.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                The Platform allows parents or guardians to manage and specify the question type, session time span, lessons per session, questions per lesson, and the amount of screen time earned for completing each lesson. The Platform also tracks the learner's progress, allowing parents or guardians to monitor their strengths and weaknesses, and adjust their learning experiences accordingly. The goal of FirstWork is to promote skill building, knowledge acquisition, reinforcement of learning, and to limit learning regression utilizing devices that would otherwise be used for entertainment purposes. The Platform is designed to benefit all learners, especially those with special learning needs.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Every learner is unique and has unique learning needs and preferences. We make no promise or guarantee that the Platform will meet the needs of any particular End User.

We are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at [info@firstworkapp.com]. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party may seek to submit the dispute to arbitration by sending to the other party, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute. The Notice of Dispute to us should be sent to our address identified below ("Notice Address").

Except for disputes brought in small claims court, all disputes between you and FirstWork arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Platform shall be exclusively settled through binding arbitration pursuant to the then-current rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") for consumer arbitration. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court and review by a court is limited. YOU AND FIRSTWORK AGREE THAT ANY SUCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, if the class-action waiver in the prior sentence is deemed invalid or unenforceable, however, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration. This arbitration agreement is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator's award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if FirstWork makes any future change to this dispute resolution provision, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice of to FirstWork.
